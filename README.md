Transcendental functions for _bitreproducibility_ in the context of `Stella`, `Cosmo` and the CrClim project.

### What is this repository for? ###

* This repository contains the experimental code for the transcendental functions that are added to Stella for bitreproduciblity. The proposed implementation concerns the `log`, the `exp` and the `pow` mathematical functions. For now the implementation are only for `double` values.

* The code is actually experimental and it intended to run on CPU and GPU.

### How do I get set up? ###

* The test depends on Google Test (https://github.com/google/googletest) and should be installed on the machine running the tests.

* A Cuda and a `C++` compiler (ie. `nvcc 7.0.27` or `g++ 4.9.3`) compatible with C++11 is needed

* The test tools and the math functions must be compiled first:
    * `g++ -std=c++11 -c test_tools.cpp`
    * `g++ -c cpu_mch_math.cpp`

* Then the tests are compiled like: 
`nvcc -g --std=c++11 -isystem ${GTEST}/googletest/include cuda_unittest.cu ${GTEST}/build/googlemock/gtest/libgtest.a test_tools.o cpu_mch_math.o -o mathUnitTests.out`

Finally run the tests like: `srun -n 1 -p debug --gres=gpu:1 -t 00:10:00 ./mathUnitTests.out`. This produces an output of the form:
```
