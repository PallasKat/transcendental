Transcendental functions for _bitreproducibility_.

### What is this repository for? ###

* This repository contains the experimental code for the transcendental functions that are added to Stella for bitreproduciblity. The proposed implementation concerns the log, the exp and the pow mathematical functions. For now the implementation are only for `double` values.

* The code is actually experimental and it intended to run on CPU and GPU.

### How do I get set up? ###

* Summary of set up
* Configuration
* Dependencies

### Contribution guidelines ###

* The code and the test are written by Christophe Charpilloz (MeteoSwiss)
* The mathematical implementation are inspired by the one proposed by Nvidia Corporation (http://www.nvidia.com)
